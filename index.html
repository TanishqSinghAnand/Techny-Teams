                Have you ever wondered that how are these laptops , mobile phones , smart television devices
                work? The simple answer it by coding . This this modern era in which we can built our own 
                apps and websites as per as our use.Outside from the implications of coding which look good on a resume, coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful to most jobs. Problem solving and logic are the main two. Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain.
